The market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 14.1% from 2024 to 2030. This growth is driven by increasing demand for environmentally friendly refrigerants with lower global warming potential (GWP), especially in sectors such as refrigeration, air conditioning, and foam blowing agents. Governments' stringent regulations regarding the phase-out of high-GWP refrigerants are also accelerating the adoption of HFO-1234ze in various applications, boosting market expansion across regions.</p><p>The growth in the HFO-1234ze market is further supported by advancements in manufacturing technology and the rising need for energy-efficient systems. As industries transition towards sustainable alternatives, HFO-1234ze's unique properties, including its low environmental impact and high energy efficiency, position it as a key player in replacing older refrigerants. As a result, HFO-1234ze is anticipated to experience significant market penetration in the coming years, further driving its demand in diverse industrial applications, particularly in the automotive and commercial refrigeration sectors.</p>-6) Market size was valued at USD 0.34 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 1.03 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 14.8% from 2024 to 2030. The growing demand for low-global-warming-potential (GWP) refrigerants, coupled with stringent environmental regulations to phase out high-GWP refrigerants, is expected to drive the market. HFO-1234ze is increasingly being used in refrigeration, air conditioning, and fire extinguishing applications due to its low toxicity and non-flammability, positioning it as a key alternative to traditional refrigerants like HFC-134a and HFC-245fa. The transition towards more sustainable solutions across various industries is contributing to the market's expansion during the forecast period.</p><p>Moreover, technological advancements in refrigeration and HVAC systems, along with an increasing focus on energy efficiency, are expected to further fuel demand for HFO-1234ze. Governments worldwide are also offering incentives and regulatory support to encourage the adoption of green refrigerants, which will continue to boost the market. With a growing emphasis on sustainability, the HFO-1234ze market is poised to witness significant growth. The Asia-Pacific region, in particular, is expected to account for a substantial share of the global market due to the high demand for eco-friendly refrigerants and increasing industrialization in emerging economies.</p></p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Request PDF Sample Copy of Report: (Including Full TOC, List of Tables &amp; Figures, Chart)&nbsp;@&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/71518/&utm_source=github-GC&utm_medium=277" target="_blank">https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/71518/&utm_source=github-GC&utm_medium=277</a></strong></strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class="">HCFO-1233zd (CAS 2730-43-0) Market&nbsp;Overview and Projection:</h3><p id="" class="">Using a deliberate segmentation technique, the HCFO-1233zd (CAS 2730-43-0) Market research study provides a comprehensive analysis of multiple market segments, including application, type, and location.
