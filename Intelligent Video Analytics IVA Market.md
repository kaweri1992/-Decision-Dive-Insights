Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the key drivers behind this growth:### 1. **Rising Demand for Enhanced Security**With increasing security concerns, businesses, governments, and municipalities are adopting AI-powered video surveillance systems to enhance safety and efficiency. Traditional CCTV is evolving into more sophisticated systems capable of detecting anomalies, recognizing faces, and analyzing behaviors in real time, leading to more proactive security measures.### 2. **Advancements in Technology**Breakthroughs in deep learning and computer vision have significantly improved the accuracy and capabilities of video analytics. Modern IVA systems are not limited to basic surveillance; they can now detect and classify objects, recognize facial features, identify suspicious behavior, and even track individuals across various cameras, making them invaluable in high-security areas.### 3. **Public Safety Needs**Governments worldwide are increasing investments in IVA solutions to bolster public safety. Smart surveillance in public spaces, transportation hubs, and urban areas helps to prevent crime and enhance emergency response times. Real-time data analytics also play a critical role in disaster management and public health initiatives (such as tracking crowds in large events or monitoring traffic patterns).### 4. **Smart Cities and IoT Integration**As cities evolve into "smart" environments, the integration of IoT devices with IVA solutions allows for more intelligent infrastructure management. For example, video feeds combined with sensor data (such as traffic flow or air quality readings) can optimize urban services, reduce traffic congestion, and improve overall quality of life. The interplay between AI, IoT, and IVA technology is a key enabler for future-proofing cities.### 5. **Cloud and Edge Computing**The rise of cloud computing and edge processing is revolutionizing the IVA market. Cloud storage allows for scalable, centralized video data storage and processing, while edge computing reduces latency by enabling real-time video analysis at the device level. This combination enhances the responsiveness and efficiency of IVA systems, making them more attractive for large-scale deployments in critical sectors like retail, transportation, and infrastructure.### Market Segments Seeing Strong Adoption:- **Retail**: For loss prevention, customer behavior analysis, and optimized store operations.- **Transportation**: For vehicle tracking, traffic management, and public safety monitoring in transit hubs.- **Critical Infrastructure**: To safeguard key assets and ensure security around energy, water, and telecommunications facilities.### Future OutlookThe IVA market is expected to maintain a strong CAGR of 16.4% between 2024 and 2030, reaching an estimated value of USD 14.56 billion by the end of the decade. The continued development of AI models, the transition to more scalable cloud-based solutions, and the growth of smart city initiatives will continue to propel the market forward. Moreover, as more industries realize the potential of video analytics for operational efficiency and security, IVA technologies will become even more embedded in daily business and governmental operations.</p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Request PDF Sample Copy of Report: (Including Full TOC, List of Tables &amp; Figures, Chart)&nbsp;@&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/65331/&utm_source=github-GC&utm_medium=277" target="_blank">https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/65331/&utm_source=github-GC&utm_medium=277</a></strong></strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class="">Intelligent Transport System Market&nbsp;Overview and Projection:</h3><p id="" class="">Using a deliberate segmentation technique, the Intelligent Transport System Market research study provides a comprehensive analysis of multiple market segments, including application, type, and location.
